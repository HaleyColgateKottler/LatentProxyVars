A Latent Variable Method for Using Proxy Variables to Address Unmeasured Confounding

Haley Colgate Kottler, Amy Cochran

This repository contains the code necessary to run comparisons of our simplified proxy variable method against the standard techniques including inverse probability weighting and linear modeling.  See 'tests.qmd' for the tests, 'latentMethod.R' for our method, and 'comparisonMethods.R' for our implementations of the comparison methods.
